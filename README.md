## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Theara, a soon to be software engineer with a natural talent of music and art, based in Phnom Penh city.

I am currently a sophormore majoring in Computer Science at Paragon IU. I have partipipated in school group projects, such as website development, UX/UI design, and made data analysis, to help the group sprint towards our project goals. I also won P-Voice Singing Competition at Paragon IU and I am really proud of myself for that achievement. 

I am really fascinated by Machine Learning Products, and algorithms. I would love to elavate myself on that topic in the future.

Outside of school, I am also an aspiring artists who loves to draw and sing. I love creating things, and fill it in will life, love, and colors.
